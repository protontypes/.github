# Open Community Accelerating Free and Sustainable Technology

Earth's uniqueness in creating a stable environment for life in a completely hostile space is a miracle. Various life forms have taken billions of years to build the natural resources that humans depend on, such as a protective atmosphere, fertile soil, stable weather and clean drinking water. As a movement to democratise technology development and knowledge creation, Open Source has the potential to become a central driver in preserving this stability. 

**Our's mission is to bring strengthen projects and communities that preserve natural ecosystems through open technologies, methods, data, information, knowledge or tools.**
